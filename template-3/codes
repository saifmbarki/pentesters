If your scan involves running Nmap scripts that take a long time to complete, you may want to consider running the scripts asynchronously so that your web application doesn't hang while the script runs. Here's one approach you could take:

Define a Celery task that runs the Nmap script asynchronously. You can use the celery package to do this. Here's an example:
================
from celery import shared_task
import subprocess

@shared_task
def run_nmap_scan(ip_address):
    cmd = f'nmap -sV {ip_address}'
    proc = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True)
    # Parse the output of the Nmap scan and store the results in the database

======================
Modify your Django view to call the Celery task instead of running the Nmap script directly. Here's an example:
========================

from myapp.tasks import run_nmap_scan
from myapp.models import Scan

def start_scan(request):
    scan_id = request.POST['scan_id']
    scan = Scan.objects.get(id=scan_id)
    run_nmap_scan.delay(scan.ip_address)
    return redirect('scan-details', scan_id=scan_id)
==================================

In this example, the start_scan view retrieves the Scan object from the database and passes the IP address to the Celery task using run_nmap_scan.delay(scan.ip_address). The delay method is used to run the task asynchronously in the background.

When the Nmap script completes, it should store the results in the database so that they can be displayed on the scan details page. You can use Django's ORM to do this.

Keep in mind that this is just a rough example to give you an idea of how to implement this functionality. You'll need to modify the code to fit your specific requirements and environment.
